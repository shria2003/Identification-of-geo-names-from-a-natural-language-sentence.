Since natural language processing (NLP) applications are becoming more and more common, it is crucial to accurately identify and disambiguate place names for a variety of activities, including information retrieval and data analysis. This project offers a comprehensive method that combines fuzzy matching algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) approaches, and geocoding services to provide reliable place name disambiguation and precise geocoding. Through tackling issues with data quality, geographical variety, and spelling variations, the suggested approach seeks to improve place name processing accuracy and dependability across a range of datasets.

The project leverages well-known NLP libraries for named entity recognition, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging, including StanfordNLP, NLTK, and spaCy. In order to provide proper matching and disambiguation, fuzzy matching algorithms—such as fuzzywuzzy and difflib—are used to manage variances and inconsistencies in place names. Pandas and NumPy are two data processing frameworks that are used to automate data analysis and manipulation, making it possible to handle big and varied datasets quickly and effectively.

correct geographic data representation is enhanced by the integration of geocoding services, such as OpenStreetMap Nominatim and the Google Maps API, which provide correct place name resolution and exact geocoding. Geospatial information is presented in a comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing manner by utilizing visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize the studied data and outcomes.
